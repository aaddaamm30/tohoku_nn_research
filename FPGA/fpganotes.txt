FPGA TIME 
small scale fpga mnist implementation 
takes 5x5 matrix of binary foreground
background images and classifies them. 

7/3/2017
all ip modules have been created. 
activation and activation prime created.
linear feedback shift register tested
and confirmed. sigmoid and sigmoid prime
tested and confirmed. 

Tomorrow overarching design for states 
will be completed. Ultimately it will be 
just a complex state machine. Shoutout
dj turing. 

modified the c++ mnist classifier to both
run train and test inbetween epochs for 
better data gathering. Code updated in
github so parallel test can be run from
my home pc and work pc. Hopefully will
be able to have multiple learning curve and
learning maxout graphs for at least three
different batch sizes and three different 
step values and potentially add in a different
activation function for fun. (ReLU with 
saturation?).
