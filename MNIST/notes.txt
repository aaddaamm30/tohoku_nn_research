MNIST simulation in C++

4/25/2017
So for now I am going to simulate a recurrent Neural
Network that runs the benchmark MNIST handwritten
number catagorization test. I'm making this git
repository so I am able to work in the lab as well
as from the dorm or the library. The steps I will
take to complete this will be as follows. 
1.) Design solution on paper and review past work
2.) make program

Obviously there will be parts 1.1 and 2.1 but thats
a later problem.
